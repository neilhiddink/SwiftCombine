### Overview

The Combine framework provides a declarative Swift API for processing values over time. These values can represent many kinds of asynchronous events. Combine declares publishers to expose values that can change over time, and subscribers to receive those values from the publishers.

- The Publisher protocol declares a type that can deliver a sequence of values over time. Publishers have operators to act on the values received from upstream publishers and republish them.

- At the end of a chain of publishers, a Subscriber acts on elements as it receives them. Publishers only emit values when explicitly requested to do so by subscribers. This puts your subscriber code in control of how fast it receives events from the publishers itâ€™s connected to.

Several Foundation types expose their functionality through publishers, including Timer, NotificationCenter, and URLSession. Combine also provides a built-in publisher for any property thatâ€™s compliant with Key-Value Observing.

You can combine the output of multiple publishers and coordinate their interaction. For example, you can subscribe to updates from a text fieldâ€™s publisher, and use the text to perform URL requests. You can then use another publisher to process the responses and use them to update your app.
By adopting Combine, youâ€™ll make your code easier to read and maintain, by centralizing your event-processing code and eliminating troublesome techniques like nested closures and convention-based callbacks.


[Receiving and Handling Events with Combine](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine/receiving_and_handling_events_with_combine)

Publishers
protocol Publisher
Declares that a type can transmit a sequence of values over time.
enum Publishers
A namespace for types that serve as publishers.
struct AnyPublisher
A type-erasing publisher.
protocol ConnectablePublisher
A publisher that provides an explicit means of connecting and canceling publication.
struct Published
A type that publishes a property marked with an attribute.
protocol Cancellable
A protocol indicating that an activity or action supports cancellation.
class AnyCancellable
A type-erasing cancellable object that executes a provided closure when canceled.
Convenience Publishers
class Future
A publisher that eventually produces a single value and then finishes or fails.
struct Just
A publisher that emits an output to each subscriber just once, and then finishes.
struct Deferred
A publisher that awaits subscription before running the supplied closure to create a publisher for the new subscriber.
struct Empty
A publisher that never publishes any values, and optionally finishes immediately.
struct Fail
A publisher that immediately terminates with the specified error.
struct Record
A publisher that allows for recording a series of inputs and a completion, for later playback to each subscriber.
Subscribers
protocol Subscriber
A protocol that declares a type that can receive input from a publisher.
enum Subscribers
A namespace for types that serve as subscribers.
struct AnySubscriber
A type-erasing subscriber.
protocol Subscription
A protocol representing the connection of a subscriber to a publisher.
enum Subscriptions
A namespace for symbols related to subscriptions.
Subjects
protocol Subject
A publisher that exposes a method for outside callers to publish elements.
class CurrentValueSubject
A subject that wraps a single value and publishes a new element whenever the value changes.
class PassthroughSubject
A subject that broadcasts elements to downstream subscribers.
Schedulers
protocol Scheduler
A protocol that defines when and how to execute a closure.
struct ImmediateScheduler
A scheduler for performing synchronous actions.
protocol SchedulerTimeIntervalConvertible
A protocol that provides a scheduler with an expression for relative time.
Observable Objects
protocol ObservableObject
A type of object with a publisher that emits before the object has changed.
class ObservableObjectPublisher
A publisher that publishes changes from observable objects.
Encoders and Decoders
protocol TopLevelEncoder
A type that defines methods for encoding.
protocol TopLevelDecoder
A type that defines methods for decoding.
Debugging Identifiers
protocol CustomCombineIdentifierConvertible
A protocol for uniquely identifying publisher streams.
struct CombineIdentifier
A unique identifier for identifying publisher streams
